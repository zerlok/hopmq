# HopMQ Roadmap: Building the Future of Async RabbitMQ for Python

**TODO: review generated text**

## Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 months)

### 🏗️ Project Setup

- Create the GitHub repository (name: `hopmq`).
- Set up project structure with Poetry or Hatch for dependency management.
- Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for testing and publishing.
- Define initial architecture:
    - Connection manager.
    - Channel abstraction.
    - Basic publisher/consumer.

### 🧪 Core Functionality (MVP)

- Async connection handling with automatic reconnection.
- Basic message publishing and consuming.
- Graceful shutdown and cleanup.
- Logging and error handling.

### 📘 Documentation

- README with installation and usage guide.
- Basic examples to showcase publishing/consuming.

---

## Phase 2: Core Features (2-3 months)

### ✨ Messaging Patterns

- Direct, fanout, topic, and headers exchanges.
- Consumer groups with message acknowledgments.
- RPC pattern with automatic correlation ID handling.

### 🧩 Developer Experience

- Context managers for connections and channels.
- Declarative consumers via decorators (e.g., `@app.consumer`).
- Type hints and Pydantic support for payload validation.

### 🔧 Reliability & Resilience

- Connection pooling.
- Configurable retry and backoff strategies.
- Heartbeats and automatic recovery.

---

## Phase 3: Optimization & Ecosystem (2-3 months)

### 🛠️ Performance Enhancements

- Connection multiplexing to reduce overhead.
- Memory and CPU profiling.
- Benchmarks against existing libraries.

### 📚 Ecosystem & Tooling

- CLI tool for local testing and debugging.
- Middleware support (logging, tracing, metrics).
- Monitoring hooks for Prometheus or OpenTelemetry.

### 📖 Docs & Community

- Full API reference and usage examples.
- Tutorials for common use cases.
- Set up Discord or Slack community.

---

## Phase 4: Launch & Beyond (Ongoing)

### 🚀 Public Release (v1.0)

- Package release on PyPI.
- Announce on Reddit, Hacker News, and Python communities.

### 🔄 Feedback & Iteration

- Collect user feedback.
- Prioritize features and bug fixes.
- Plan for long-term maintenance and versioning strategy.
